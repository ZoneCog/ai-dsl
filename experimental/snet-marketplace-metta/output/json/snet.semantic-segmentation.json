The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.<br></br>Use this service to associate each pixel of a provided image with a class label such as identifying cars, bicycles and people. Useful for applications such as autonomous driving, manufacturing robotics, medical imaging and video surveillance. <br></br>Simply upload an image you want to analyse and hit Invoke, the image will then be processed and the results displayed. </div>",
