        "description": " Photrek\u2019s Risk Assessment Service provides a graphical and quantitative assessment of probabilistic forecasts. The user inputs a vector of probabilities forecasted for a set of events that actually occurred; i.e. the outcome of a test. The assessment consists of a histogram of the probabilities forecasted and an overlay of three metrics (Accuracy, Decisiveness, and Robustness).\n\nThe metrics derive from a generalization of information theory but are presented in the probability domain for improved understanding. The Accuracy metric is a translation of the log-likelihood or cross-entropy into the probability domain and is computed by geometric mean. The Robustness metric is sensitive to the worst performance of the algorithm and is measured by the -2/3rds power of the generalized mean. The Decisiveness metric approximates the classification performance of making a decision with the probabilities and is measured by the arithmetic mean. (test)"
